# RIT_CB_Steering_Data_2025
Data from "The effect of unilateral cortical blindness on lane position and gaze behavior in a virtual reality steering task".

This repository includes a google drive link to the compressed data from each participant that is represented in this paper's analysis. There are 9 control participants and 21 cortically-blind participants (CB). The key titled "CB group labels" identifies which participants had CB on the left side of their visual field, and which had CB on the right.
